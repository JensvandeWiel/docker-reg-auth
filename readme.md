# Docker registry auth
This repo shows how to setup a private registry with your own authentication server.
This repo can be used as library to use the helpers to easily create a registry auth server. 

This repo implements this spec: https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/auth/token/

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or PR.

Help is wanted since the spec is not fully implemented yet, but it is usable.

# Todo
- [] Add refresh_token support and add it to the response
- [] Add support for multiple scopes
